# 🚀 LeetCode Daily — My DSA Revival Journey  
Welcome to my **LeetCode Daily repo!**  
I’m restarting my Data Structures & Algorithms journey from **absolute basics**, tracking my progress publicly to stay accountable and help others learn with me 💪

## 🎯 Goal  
Solve **at least 1 LeetCode problem every day**  
→ Build problem-solving consistency  
→ Strengthen fundamentals  
→ Crack top product-based interviews

## 🌱 Current Stage: Back to Basics  
Topics I’m covering first:
- Arrays
- Strings
